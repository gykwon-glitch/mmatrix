Description: Provides a safe, sparse, and reproducible formula-to-matrix pipeline
  for high-dimensional data. The core constructor builds a sparse design matrix
  and a frozen encoding ("spec") that stores factor levels, contrasts, and
  transformation rules for consistent application to new data. The package also
  includes transparent collinearity handling, level management, and comprehensive
  reporting of dropped or aliased columns.
